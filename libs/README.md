# libs

This module contains libraries written in Quarkdown ([main/resources](src/main/resources)).

The Gradle build system will automatically copy the `.qmd` files into the `lib/qmd` directory of the distribution zip.  
At runtime, the CLI option `-l` or `--libs` sets the path to the library directory to use, which clearly defaults to `lib/qmd`.

In order to load a library from the library directory, the `.include {name}` function can be used.
After the library is loaded, the functions defined in the library can be used in the main document.
