# test

This module contains unit tests that take actual Quarkdown sources as inputs, making sure they produce the expected
final output by correctly executing each step of the compilation pipeline, from lexing to rendering.

The programs make use of the [stdlib](../stdlib), and libraries from [libs](../libs) can be also included.
